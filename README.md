- 👋 Hi, I’m @Autiemedia, I run a small IT business, videography business and I am finally getting back into programming, starting with front end dev.
- 👀 I’m interested in pretty much anything. I easily find interest in a lot of different fields.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics again with some HTML, CSS and JS. I used to be really into Python and SQL but stopped coding a few years ago. Want to get a front end job, so I'm starting up again!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing specific.
- 📫 How to reach me visit my website at aurumtechllc.com, or email me at media@aurumtechllc.com. You can also find my Youtube channel at Levi Brooks.
